Hi there!

My name is Konstantinos (Kostis) Tsaprailis.

I have graduated with an Electrical & Computer Engineer diploma by the [National Technical University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html).

Currently I'm a part time student in the Data Science Master's program of the [Athens University of Economics and Business](http://www.aueb.gr/index_en.php).

I'm also working as a Support Software Engineer in the Athens branch of [Openbet](https://www.openbet.com/).
