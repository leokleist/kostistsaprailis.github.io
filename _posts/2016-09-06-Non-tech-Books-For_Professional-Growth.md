<!--excerpt-->

A few days ago a submitted a [question](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12415621) to Hacker News regarding which books have helped people most professionally besides the usual tech ones.

I got many more answers that I expected and I think it's worth going through the full thread to get specific insight for each book.

I have compiled a list with these books ordered by genre which can be found [here](https://github.com/kostistsaprailis/non-tech-books-for-developers).

If you think there's another book that might have helped you and is not on that list feel free to open an issue on the above repository to get it added.
